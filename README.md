# AWS_Infrastructure_Using_Terraform
Objective:
1. Using Terraform, design and set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both public and private subnets. Implement routing, security groups, and network access control lists (NACLs) to ensure proper communication and security within the VPC, as well as between the VPC and an Ubuntu EC2 instance in each subnet. Work in the AWS EU-West-1 (Ireland) region.
2. Use the official Terraform registry to write your code
3. Write a script to install Nginx on your EC2 instance in the public subnet on deployment
4. Write a script to install PostgreSQL on your EC2 instance in the public subnet on deployment
5. Clean up the resource on completion using terraform destroy
